Galaxies, averaging an estimated 100 million stars,[3] range in size from dwarfs with less than a hundred million stars, to the largest galaxies known – supergiants with one hundred trillion stars,[4] each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Most of the mass in a typical galaxy is in the form of dark matter, with only a few percent of that mass visible in the form of stars and nebulae. Supermassive black holes are a common feature at the centres of galaxies.</p>
